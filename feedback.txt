Alex Tepper & Anabel Rivera: Data Governance and Structure Boarding School
The databases knowledge in this project is very impressive! 
Your project overwall is really well structured and the code is clean. I just wish you could use more concepts we've learn from w1-w4,
such as OOP and API/JSON.
